# Ensign Pre-assessment assignment

## Assignment 1
Please download `assignment-1-html-css` folder, and open `index.html` in your web browser.

#### Technical decisions and assumptions
- tested on latest Firefox, Chrome, and Safari web browsers
- uses `rem` units for flexibility, but no breakpoints have been set, so the layout is not responsive
- uses `modern-normalize` stylesheet to reset base CSS styles for consistency across different browsers

## Assignment 2
Please download both `assignment-2-back-end` and `assignment-2-shopping-cart` folders.

### Database
We are using *PostgreSQL* (psql) in a *Docker* container to provide a database service to the application. Please follow these instructions to set up the container.

#### Setup instructions

1. In your terminal, open the root folder of this repository (where this `README.md` file is located)
2. Run the command `docker compose up`
3. Done

This will build, create, start, and attach the psql container. By default, it can be accessed on port 55000, with the following connection URI: `postgres://postgres:postgrespw@localhost:55000/shopping-cart`

If you need to change the default settings, you can edit the `./docker-compose.yml` file.

### Back-end (`assignment-2-back-end`)
The back-end is built on *NodeJS* with the *Express* framework. We use *TypeScript* for part of our application to provide type annotation and checking.

#### Setup instructions
1. In a new terminal instance/window, open the `assignment-2-back-end` folder of this repository
2. Run the command `npm install` to fetch and install all the project dependencies
3. Copy and rename `sample.env` to `.env` to provide the necessary configuration for the back-end service
4. Edit `.env` to suit your environment (default port is `4000`, database connection URI follows above)
5. Run the command `npm build` to generate the application files
6. Run the command `npm start` to start the application, and connect to the database
7. In your web browser, open `http://localhost:4000/setupData` (adjust URL as necessary) to setup the tables and sample data in the database
8. Done

#### Technical decisions and assumptions
- uses *Sequelize* ORM (https://sequelize.org/) to simplify Model definition and querying
- uses *`bcryptjs`* and *`jsonwebtoken`* for authentication, generating, and verifying access token
- front-end views are not provided, as the routes will be consumed as a JSON API

### Front-end (`assignment-2-back-end`)
The front-end is built with the *React* library. *Jotai* is used to handle shared state managmement (more details below), and *Tailwind CSS* is used to simplify writing CSS for the UI.

#### Setup instructions
1. In a new terminal instance/window, open the `assignment-2-shopping-cart` folder of this repository
2. Run the command `npm install` to fetch and install all the project dependencies
3. Copy and rename `sample.env` to `.env` to provide the necessary configuration for the front-end service
4. Edit `.env` to suit your environment (default front-end service port is `3000`, default back-end URL is `http://localhost:4000`)
5. Run the command `npm start` to start the application
6. In your web browser, open `http://localhost:3000` (adjust URL as necessary) to view the application
7. Done

#### Usage instructions
1. Register a user account by navigating to the **Register** (`http://localhost:3000/register`) page 
2. Login to that user account in the **Login** (`http://localhost:3000/login`) page
3. After logging in, access the **Products** (`http://localhost:3000/products`) page to view a list of products
4. Select a product and click to visit the **Product detail** (e.g. `http://localhost:3000/product/1`) page, where you can add the product to the cart 
5. Review your cart in the **Cart** (`http://localhost:3000/cart`) page, where you can adjust the quantity or remove the item
6. Once you are satisfied with the items in your cart, you can click the **Check Out** button in the **Cart** page to save your order
7. Your saved orders can be reviewed in the **Orders** (`http://localhost:3000/orders`) page
8. Once you are finished with your session, you may log out of the application by clicking on the "**Logout**" link in the top right cornerâ€”this will clear your user access token (but preserve your cart for future sessions)
9. The user access token will expire 1 hour after logging in, and you will be returned to the **Home** page to login or register again
 
#### Technical decisions and assumptions
- uses *axios* to facilitate XHR requests and transformation
    - protected routes, like `/products` and `/orders` require authenticated calls to the back-end service. The back-end service will return errors for unauthenticated or invalid requests
    - the User access token is stored in `localStorage` for simplicity and persistence, and this is validated whenever the user attempts to access a protected route, e.g. Products or Orders. The token is valid for 1 hour after logging in
- uses *date-fns* to simplify date formatting
- uses *react-router-dom* to facilitate client-side routing
- shared state across the application (e.g. Cart, User, and Products) is handled by Jotai, to simplify managing state across the various components (vs. passing getters and setters as props, etc.)
    - Cart state, this is stored in `localStorage` for simplicity and persistence (e.g. when restarting web browser), although this will present the same cart across different user accounts if logged in on the same web browser
    - User state, we store the userId, username, and token in `localStorage` so that the user's session can persist if the web browser is restarted, of course, verifying that the token is still valid
    - Products state, this is stored within a Jotai atom, and is loaded once when the user first loads a component that requires it. This minimises the number of XHR requests especially since the product list for this application is static. In the event that the product list is constantly changing (e.g pagination, filtering, inventory levels, etc.), we can switch to fetching from the back-end on each call, with some re-architecture of the dependent components
- component-level state is handled by React's built-in `useState` hook
    - Orders state, this is handled at the component-level, as there is no need to persist the data or reference it in other components (at this time)
- Data for Products, Users, and Orders are stored in the database for persistence, and ease of managing the multiple user nature
- no breakpoints have been set, so the layout is not responsive (apart from the default Tailwind CSS considerations)
- form validation is minimal due to time constraint
- messages (e.g. "Logged in successfully", "Order saved", etc.) are currently static, but if needed, a message flashing package and transition package can be used to improve the UX
- additional features like Forgot...Reset Password, Product page categorisation, sorting, and pagination, etc. can be introduced to improve the UX, but not included due to time constraint
